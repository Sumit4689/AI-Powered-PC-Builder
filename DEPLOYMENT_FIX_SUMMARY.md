# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the 404 error issue with the Vercel deployment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Structure

We restructured the backend to work properly with Vercel's serverless functions:

1. **Created a proper API entry point**:
   - Created/updated `/api/index.js` as the serverless function entry point
   - This file imports the Express app from `server.js` and exports it
   
2. **Updated server.js**:
   - Added a root path handler (`app.get('/', ...)`) to respond to the root URL
   - Added a health check endpoint (`app.get('/health', ...)`)
   - Made sure the Express app is properly exported

3. **Updated vercel.json**:
   - Updated the source path to point to `api/index.js` instead of `server.js`
   - Set up proper routes to forward all requests to the serverless function

### 2. Testing and Validation

1. **Created testing scripts**:
   - `BackEnd/utils/deploymentTest.js` - Tests backend API endpoints
   - `FrontEnd/utils/connectivityTest.js` - Tests frontend-backend connectivity and CORS

2. **Updated documentation**:
   - Enhanced the `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` with detailed steps for Vercel deployment
   - Added troubleshooting information specific to Vercel deployments
   - Updated the README.md to include deployment information

### 3. CORS Configuration

1. **Verified CORS settings**:
   - Made sure the backend has the correct CORS configuration
   - Added documentation for setting the correct `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable

## Key Points for Successful Deployment

1. **Serverless Function Structure**: Vercel requires a specific structure for serverless functions, with all requests routed to `/api/index.js`.

2. **Environment Variables**: Both backend and frontend need proper environment variables set in the Vercel dashboard:
   - Backend: `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `FRONTEND_URL`, etc.
   - Frontend: `VITE_API_URL` (pointing to the deployed backend)

3. **CORS Configuration**: The backend must be configured to accept requests from the frontend domain.

4. **Health Check**: A root endpoint (`/`) and health check (`/health`) are important for monitoring the deployment.

## Testing the Deployment

After deploying both backend and frontend to Vercel:

1. Run `node BackEnd/utils/deploymentTest.js` to test backend API endpoints
2. Run `node FrontEnd/utils/connectivityTest.js` to test frontend-backend connectivity
3. Update the URLs in both scripts to match your actual deployed URLs

If the tests pass successfully, the deployment should be working correctly.

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **404 Error**: Usually means the serverless function is not set up correctly or not being found. Check the `/api/index.js` file and `vercel.json` configuration.

2. **CORS Error**: Check that the `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable is set correctly on the backend and matches the actual frontend URL.

3. **Database Connection Error**: Verify the `MONGODB_URI` is correct and that network access is properly configured in MongoDB Atlas.

4. **Authentication Issues**: Make sure `JWT_SECRET` is set and cookies are configured properly for secure connections.
